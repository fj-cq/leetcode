 * Given an integer array with even length,
 * where different numbers in this array represent different kinds of candies.
 * Each number means one candy of the corresponding kind.
 * You need to distribute these candies equally in number to brother and sister.
 * Return the maximum number of kinds of candies the sister could gain.
 *
 * Example 1:
